# deep-learning-models

This repo contains some deep learning models including basic NN buidling blocks. 
Those models are my assignments exercise from Deep Learning courses on Coursera by Andrew Ng.

Big thanks to Andrew Ng for providing the course and related material! It's a very good start for new people learning AI.
