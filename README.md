# deep-learning-models
This repo contains some deep learning models including basic NN buidling blocks. 
Those models are my assignments exercise from [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/).
Big thanks to Andrew Ng for providing the course and related material! It's a very good start for new people learning AI.

Models are written in Tensorflow for ConvNN, deepNN and Keras for ResNet. 
I will upload more models that I learned

### ResNet50
